## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

v1.1 decisions:

- Profile-only data sourcing — insights reads `.finyx/profile.json` directly, never invokes other advisor commands
- Per-country tax scoring only — never combine DE + BR into a single score (misleading for cross-border users)
- Projection precision: always ranges + explicit assumptions, round to €1k
- [Phase 06-reference-foundation]: FGTS counts toward BR investment rate minimum (mandatory employer 8%); INSS excluded (social insurance not savings)
- [Phase 06-reference-foundation]: Vorabpauschale fallback: use prior-year Basiszins with MEDIUM confidence flag when current-year not yet published
- [Phase 06-reference-foundation]: PGBL dimension (TAX-04) only scored for users with declaracao: completa; skip for simplificada
- [Phase 07-specialist-agents]: D-07 persist target: .finyx/config.json (not profile.json) — operational preference vs raw interview data
- [Phase 07-specialist-agents]: Allocation agent tools locked to Read, Grep, Glob only — no Write, Bash, WebSearch (D-05)
- [Phase 07-specialist-agents]: Portfolio value uses cost_basis x shares only; no live NAV lookups; labeled MEDIUM CONFIDENCE
- [Phase 07-specialist-agents]: Projection agent: monthlyCommitments is obligations proxy only — not a balance sheet liability; explicit note required in every output
- [Phase 07-specialist-agents]: Tax agent tools: Read, Grep, Glob only — no Write, Bash, WebSearch (D-05)
- [Phase 07-specialist-agents]: Germany and Brazil tax scored independently — never combined (TAX-02 requirement)
- [Phase 08-orchestrator-command]: Disclaimer emitted in Phase 2 before all financial content in /fin:insights (differs from tax.md/invest.md which append at end)
- [Phase 08-orchestrator-command]: .finyx/insights-config.json confirmed as allocation mapping target — never profile.json (D-08)
- [Phase 08-orchestrator-command]: Cross-advisor intelligence implemented inline in command prompt — no separate rule engine file (D-03)
