## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Rename to Finyx (Phase 1): rebrand package, commands, agents, docs
- Germany before Brazil (Phase 2): simpler rules, existing IMMO tax content to reuse
- Advisory only, no execution: legal disclaimers mandatory on all outputs
- APIs + web search: Finnhub (EU/US), brapi.dev (B3/FIIs), Bundesbank SDMX (Basiszins)
- [Phase 01]: profile.json merges identity/countries/goals into IMMO schema with full backward compatibility
- [Phase 01]: disclaimer.md is standalone Markdown reference doc included via @path in all advisory commands
- [Phase 01-foundation-profile]: Hard cut rename immo-cc -> finyx-cc with no coexistence period (D-01 through D-05)
- [Phase 01-foundation-profile]: init.md deleted (not moved) — replaced by finyx:profile in Plan 03

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- INSS expat treatment (Phase 4): How a Brazilian in Germany contributes to / exits BR social security is unresolved. Needs targeted research before building the Brazilian pension agent.
- Vorabpauschale 2026 Basiszins: BMF publishes the 2026 rate in early 2026; reference docs must be updated as soon as available.
- Law 15,270/2025 FII interaction: dividend withholding + FII exemption edge cases need Receita Federal source confirmation before Phase 2 ships.
