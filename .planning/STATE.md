## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All prior decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

v2.1 key context:

- Plugin auto-update is native (claude plugin update finyx) — no update skill needed
- Insurance skill must be generic, not biased to any specific user's providers
- User has 12 insurance types as reference for coverage scope
- Health insurance (Krankenversicherung/PKV/GKV) already covered in v1.2 — must migrate to sub-skill in Phase 18
- Router must come first: all per-type sub-skills depend on ARCH-01
- Reference docs + agents must precede type sub-skills (Phase 19 before 21/22)
- Phase 21 and 22 can only start after Phase 19 (not after each other — they are parallel-capable but sequenced by instruction)
- §34d GewO: all outputs recommend criteria, never specific competing tariffs
- Kfz is most complex type: SF-Klasse, Typklasse, Regionalklasse, three coverage levels
- Stiftung Warentest/Finanztip as primary sources; Check24/Verivox as fallback only
- BU (Berufsunfähigkeit) deferred to v2.2 — own milestone due to complexity
- [Phase 18-router-sub-skill-migration]: Router SKILL.md is a pure dispatcher (~96 lines) with zero health-specific logic; all advisory content lives in sub-skill files
- [Phase 18-router-sub-skill-migration]: Sub-skill files are plain Markdown (no YAML frontmatter, no execution_context block) loaded by Read tool at dispatch time
- [Phase 19-01]: Use short slugs (hausrat, haftpflicht, kfz) as type enum for insurance.policies — matches reference doc filenames and enables direct path construction in agents
- [Phase 19-reference-docs-profile-schema-agents]: coverage_type annotation on every reference doc prevents portfolio agent from comparing sum-based and service-based coverage monetarily
- [Phase 19-reference-docs-profile-schema-agents]: kfz.md: one policy entry per Kfz contract; three coverage tiers captured in coverage_components field, not separate entries
- [Phase 19]: Health type retains existing PKV 3-provider comparison; all other types use criteria-only output per §34d GewO
- [Phase 19]: Portfolio agent loads all 11 reference docs unconditionally in execution_context
- [Phase 20]: insurance.monthly_cost prohibition text in allocation agent prompt is intentional — single occurrence tells agent not to use defunct field
- [Phase 20-portfolio-analysis]: Sub-skill writes to profile.json only in Phase 0 empty-portfolio entry; all other output is conversational
- [Phase 20-portfolio-analysis]: Portfolio sub-skill spawns single agent (not parallel) — portfolio agent consolidates all analysis internally
- [Phase 21-per-type-sub-skills-tier-1-2]: Kfz sub-skill: vehicle age brackets use 4-tier structure from kfz.md (0-3, 3-7, 7-12, 12+) for alignment with reference doc
- [Phase 21-per-type-sub-skills-tier-1-2]: Kfz sub-skill: 30.11 cancellation deadline is calendar-pinned (1-month Kuendigungsfrist on 01.01 renewal) — documented explicitly as Kfz-unique rule
- [Phase 21-02]: Staffelung warning unconditional in Zahnzusatz — shown even without immediate dental needs as structural purchase risk
- [Phase 21-02]: Risikoleben renewal_date = policy END DATE (Vertragsende) — displayed as 'Policy expires', never 'Next renewal'
- [Phase 21-02]: Gesundheitsprüfung warning placed in 3 locations in Risikoleben (disclaimer, cancellation, recommendation) — intentional due to severity of cancel-before-approval mistake
