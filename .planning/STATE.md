## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0/v1.1 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

v1.2 key decisions:

- Health data is session-only, never persisted (GDPR Art. 9 compliance)
- Two agents: deterministic calc agent + WebSearch research agent
- Beamter path deferred to v1.3 (BEAM-01) — standard PKV model overstates cost for Beihilfe users
- Build order: reference doc → agents → command → cross-advisor integration
- [Phase 09-reference-foundation]: tax_year: 2025 in frontmatter matches existing doc convention; 2026-effective constants published under 2025 rules
- [Phase 09-reference-foundation]: fallback_rate 2.9% + source_url pattern for GKV Zusatzbeitrag — Phase 10 agent fetches live, falls back to this
- [Phase 10-specialist-agents]: Neutral source hierarchy: Stiftung Warentest/Finanztip/krankenkasseninfo.de first, Check24 fallback only (D-02)
- [Phase 10-specialist-agents]: Exactly 3 PKV providers in research output to prevent analysis paralysis (D-03)
- [Phase 10-specialist-agents]: All GKV/PKV rates read from health-insurance.md at runtime — zero hardcoded constants in calc agent
- [Phase 10-specialist-agents]: Health flags are session-only: received inline in Task prompt, never written to file (GDPR Art. 9)
- [Phase 11-command-integration]: Disclaimer emitted in Phase 5 before advisory content per D-10 — matches insights.md disclaimer-first pattern
- [Phase 11-command-integration]: JAEG threshold read from health-insurance.md Section 4.1 at runtime — not hardcoded
- [Phase 11-command-integration]: bin/install.js recursive copy confirmed — no changes needed for new command and agent files
- [Phase 12-cross-advisor-integration]: Insurance fields all default to null in profile template — consistent with existing schema convention
- [Phase 12-cross-advisor-integration]: Silent skip semantics for insurance sections in both insights and tax commands — absence never blocks report generation
