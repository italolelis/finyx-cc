## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All prior decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

v2.1 key context:

- Plugin auto-update is native (claude plugin update finyx) — no update skill needed
- Insurance skill must be generic, not biased to any specific user's providers
- User has 12 insurance types as reference for coverage scope
- Health insurance (Krankenversicherung/PKV/GKV) already covered in v1.2 — must migrate to sub-skill in Phase 18
- Router must come first: all per-type sub-skills depend on ARCH-01
- Reference docs + agents must precede type sub-skills (Phase 19 before 21/22)
- Phase 21 and 22 can only start after Phase 19 (not after each other — they are parallel-capable but sequenced by instruction)
- §34d GewO: all outputs recommend criteria, never specific competing tariffs
- Kfz is most complex type: SF-Klasse, Typklasse, Regionalklasse, three coverage levels
- Stiftung Warentest/Finanztip as primary sources; Check24/Verivox as fallback only
- BU (Berufsunfähigkeit) deferred to v2.2 — own milestone due to complexity
- [Phase 18-router-sub-skill-migration]: Router SKILL.md is a pure dispatcher (~96 lines) with zero health-specific logic; all advisory content lives in sub-skill files
- [Phase 18-router-sub-skill-migration]: Sub-skill files are plain Markdown (no YAML frontmatter, no execution_context block) loaded by Read tool at dispatch time
- [Phase 19-01]: Use short slugs (hausrat, haftpflicht, kfz) as type enum for insurance.policies — matches reference doc filenames and enables direct path construction in agents
