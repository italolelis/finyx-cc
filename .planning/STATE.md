## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0/v1.1/v1.2 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Key v2.0 constraints from research:

- Skill dir naming trap: use `skills/tax/` not `skills/finyx-tax/` (preserves `/finyx:tax` syntax)
- `disable-model-invocation: true` required on ALL advisory skills (finance vocab over-triggers)
- `@~/.claude/` paths silently break — must become `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/`
- Shared agents (used by multiple skills) go to plugin root `agents/`; skill-only agents go under `skills/<name>/agents/`
- Profile skill must ship before all others (all skills depend on profile access)
- [Phase 13]: Realestate skill omits disable-model-invocation per D-07 (only tax/invest/pension/insurance/insights listed)
- [Phase 13]: All @~/.claude/finyx/templates/ paths mapped to ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/ (templates migrate into skill references)
- [Phase 14-profile-skill]: Profile skill omits disable-model-invocation (interview-based, not advisory)
- [Phase 14-profile-skill]: Two-path profile storage: .finyx/ project-local primary, ~/.finyx/ global fallback
- [Phase 15]: PKV cross-skill reference handled via fallback note — no duplication of health-insurance.md into tax skill
- [Phase 15]: Task tool removed from tax SKILL.md allowed-tools — advisory done inline, scoring agent not invoked
- [Phase 16]: Help skill omits disable-model-invocation — utility skill, not advisory
- [Phase 16]: Task tool kept in insights SKILL.md — skill orchestrates 2 parallel specialist agents (allocation + projection)
- [Phase 16]: Reference paths updated to ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/ for portability — zero @~/.claude/ in insurance SKILL.md
- [Phase 16]: Task tool removed from pension SKILL.md allowed-tools — advisory done inline, no agent delegation
- [Phase 16-bulk-migration]: Task tool removed from invest SKILL.md — broker advisory handled inline, no agent delegation
- [Phase 16-bulk-migration]: Realestate skill omits disable-model-invocation per D-07 (action-based, not advisory)
- [Phase 16-bulk-migration]: Router/orchestrator pattern in SKILL.md with routing section dispatching to 7 sub-workflows
- [Phase 17]: Remove bin/install.js entirely — plugin system replaces npm distribution, clean break per REQUIREMENTS.md Out of Scope
- [Phase 17]: Rename package from finyx-cc to finyx to match plugin.json identity
- [Phase 17-integration-distribution]: finyx/templates/location-research.md dropped — not referenced by any skill, dead content
- [Phase 17-integration-distribution]: Legacy commands/finyx/, agents/, finyx/ directories removed — all content migrated to skills/
