## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Budget tracking / expense data collection | Different product, dilutes advisory focus |
| Single combined financial health score | Gamification trap, hides component reality |
| Combined cross-jurisdiction tax score | Misleading for cross-border users, obscures which jurisdiction has gaps |
| Historical trend tracking | Requires persistent data store, defer to v2+ |
| Automated portfolio rebalancing | Advisory only, legal liability |

## Traceability
