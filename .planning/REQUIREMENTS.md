## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Tax return filing automation | Legal liability — advisory only, guide users to ELSTER/Receita Federal |
| Automated trade execution | Securities law in DE and BR; advisory-only constraint |
| Real-time portfolio sync via broker APIs | OAuth complexity, API instability; user inputs holdings manually |
| Budget tracking / expense categorization | Different product (YNAB, etc.); dilutes focus |
| Push notifications / alerting | Requires backend infrastructure; CLI tool, not a service |
| Countries beyond Germany and Brazil | Architecture supports it, but v1 scope is clear; community can add |
| Financial product affiliate links | Destroys advisory trust |
| Chat history persistence | Claude Code handles context natively |
