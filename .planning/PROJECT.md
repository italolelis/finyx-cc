# Finyx

## What This Is

Finyx is an open-source personal finance advisor built as a collection of Claude Code slash-commands and specialist AI agents. It covers tax optimization (Germany + Brazil), investment portfolio management with live market data, broker comparison, pension planning (Riester/Rürup/bAV + PGBL/VGBL/INSS), real estate investment analysis, and a unified financial insights dashboard. Users interact through `/fin:*` commands while specialist agents handle domain-specific analysis backed by a shared financial profile.

## Core Value

A single AI-powered financial advisor that knows your full financial picture — tax situation, investments, insurance, pensions, and real estate — and gives integrated, country-aware advice rather than siloed recommendations.

### Active

#### v2.0 — Plugin Architecture
- [ ] `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest for marketplace distribution
- [ ] Convert all commands into self-contained skills under `skills/`
- [ ] Each skill bundles its own agents and reference docs
- [ ] `finyx-profile` foundation skill (shared profile management)
- [ ] `finyx-insights` cross-skill integration layer
- [ ] Thin command triggers preserved for `/finyx:*` syntax
- [ ] `bin/install.js` npm fallback for backward compatibility
- [ ] Submit to Anthropic plugin directory

### Out of Scope

- Full insurance marketplace comparison (check24-style across all insurance types) — PKV/GKV decision covered in v1.2, broader comparison deferred
- Automated trading/execution — legal liability, advisory only
- Tax return filing automation — too risky, advisor guides but user files
- Real-time portfolio sync with brokers — API complexity, defer to v2
- Mobile or web app — CLI-first, other interfaces later
- Countries beyond Germany and Brazil — expand after v1 validates multi-country pattern
- Financial product affiliate links — destroys advisory trust
- Budget tracking / expense categorization — different product, dilutes focus

## Context

Shipped v1.2 with 7 new files (+1,932 lines) on top of v1.1. Total ~27,900 LOC across 116 files.
Tech stack: Claude Code slash-commands (Markdown prompts), Node.js installer, zero runtime dependencies.
6 specialist commands: `/finyx:profile`, `/finyx:tax`, `/finyx:invest`, `/finyx:broker`, `/finyx:pension`, `/finyx:insights`.
3 specialist insight agents: allocation, tax-scoring, projection.
3 legacy real estate agents preserved under finyx namespace.
Country support: Germany + Brazil with shared profile and per-country reference docs.
Distributed via npm as `finyx-cc`.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Claude Code slash-command architecture — no application framework, all logic in Markdown prompts
- **Runtime**: Node.js >=16.7.0, npm distribution, zero runtime dependencies
- **Legal**: Advisory only — all recommendations include disclaimers, no automated execution
- **Data freshness**: Market data via live web search + APIs, tax rules in versioned reference docs updated per tax year
- **Country scope**: Germany + Brazil for v1, architecture must support adding countries without refactoring

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Rename to Finyx | Broader scope beyond real estate needs a new brand | ✓ Good |
| Germany + Brazil v1 | User has direct experience in both markets | ✓ Good |
| CLI skills architecture | Proven pattern from IMMO, low friction, extensible | ✓ Good |
| Advisory only, no execution | Legal risk of automated trading/filing too high for open source | ✓ Good |
| APIs + web search for data | Finnhub (EU/US), brapi.dev (B3), Bundesbank SDMX (Basiszins) | ✓ Good |
| Insurance deferred to v2 | Data sourcing complexity, focus v1 on tax + investments | ✓ Shipped in v1.2 |
| Shared user profile | All agents read same `.finyx/profile.json` — integrated advice | ✓ Good |
| Hard cut rename (no coexistence) | Clean migration, simpler codebase | ✓ Good |
| Unconditional country doc loading | Minimal overhead, simplifies command gating logic | ✓ Good |
| VWCE as primary core ETF recommendation | Broadest diversification in single fund | ✓ Good |
| Net-after-mandatory income as benchmark denominator | Gross-based 50/30/20 is wrong for DE (~45% mandatory deductions) | ✓ Good |
| Traffic light + € gap display | Combines at-a-glance scan with actionable specifics | ✓ Good |
| Per-country scoring only (never combined) | Cross-jurisdiction combined scores are misleading | ✓ Good |
| Claude inference for cross-advisor links | Fits Markdown-prompt architecture, zero maintenance vs rule engine | ✓ Good |
| Profile-only data sourcing for insights | Agents read profile.json, never invoke other commands | ✓ Good |
| Health data session-only (GDPR Art. 9) | Health flags never persisted, only in Task prompt | ✓ Good |
| Two insurance agents (calc + research) | Deterministic calc separated from live web research | ✓ Good |
| 3-tier PKV risk model with binary flags | Balances accuracy with GDPR compliance and advisory scope | ✓ Good |
| Neutral source priority over Check24 | Avoids commercial bias in provider research | ✓ Good |
