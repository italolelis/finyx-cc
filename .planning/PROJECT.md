# Finyx

## What This Is

Finyx is an open-source personal finance advisor built as a collection of Claude Code slash-commands and specialist AI agents. It covers tax optimization (Germany + Brazil), investment portfolio management with live market data, broker comparison, pension planning (Riester/Rürup/bAV + PGBL/VGBL/INSS), real estate investment analysis, and a unified financial insights dashboard. Users interact through `/fin:*` commands while specialist agents handle domain-specific analysis backed by a shared financial profile.

## Core Value

A single AI-powered financial advisor that knows your full financial picture — tax situation, investments, insurance, pensions, and real estate — and gives integrated, country-aware advice rather than siloed recommendations.

## Requirements

### Active

#### v1.2 — Health Insurance Advisor
- [ ] `/finyx:insurance` command — PKV vs GKV decision advisor with personalized cost projections
- [ ] Health questionnaire (pre-existing conditions, chronic diseases, age) for PKV risk surcharges
- [ ] Accurate GKV vs PKV cost comparison (income-based vs age/health-based, employer share)
- [ ] Family impact analysis (Familienversicherung, children, partner separate policies)
- [ ] Tax implications (PKV Basisabsicherung deduction, employer contribution limits)
- [ ] PKV provider research agent with web search for tariffs, Beitragsrückerstattung, Selbstbeteiligung
- [ ] Expat considerations (Anwartschaft, Versicherungspflichtgrenze, EU portability)
- [ ] Long-term cost projection (PKV age growth vs GKV income-tracking growth)
- [ ] Profile integration — reads income, family, tax data from `.finyx/profile.json`

### Out of Scope

- Full insurance marketplace comparison (check24-style across all insurance types) — PKV/GKV decision covered in v1.2, broader comparison deferred
- Automated trading/execution — legal liability, advisory only
- Tax return filing automation — too risky, advisor guides but user files
- Real-time portfolio sync with brokers — API complexity, defer to v2
- Mobile or web app — CLI-first, other interfaces later
- Countries beyond Germany and Brazil — expand after v1 validates multi-country pattern
- Financial product affiliate links — destroys advisory trust
- Budget tracking / expense categorization — different product, dilutes focus

## Context

Shipped v1.1 with 6 new files (+6,351 lines) on top of v1.0 (~19,600 LOC, 102 files).
Tech stack: Claude Code slash-commands (Markdown prompts), Node.js installer, zero runtime dependencies.
6 specialist commands: `/finyx:profile`, `/finyx:tax`, `/finyx:invest`, `/finyx:broker`, `/finyx:pension`, `/finyx:insights`.
3 specialist insight agents: allocation, tax-scoring, projection.
3 legacy real estate agents preserved under finyx namespace.
Country support: Germany + Brazil with shared profile and per-country reference docs.
Distributed via npm as `finyx-cc`.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Claude Code slash-command architecture — no application framework, all logic in Markdown prompts
- **Runtime**: Node.js >=16.7.0, npm distribution, zero runtime dependencies
- **Legal**: Advisory only — all recommendations include disclaimers, no automated execution
- **Data freshness**: Market data via live web search + APIs, tax rules in versioned reference docs updated per tax year
- **Country scope**: Germany + Brazil for v1, architecture must support adding countries without refactoring

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Rename to Finyx | Broader scope beyond real estate needs a new brand | ✓ Good |
| Germany + Brazil v1 | User has direct experience in both markets | ✓ Good |
| CLI skills architecture | Proven pattern from IMMO, low friction, extensible | ✓ Good |
| Advisory only, no execution | Legal risk of automated trading/filing too high for open source | ✓ Good |
| APIs + web search for data | Finnhub (EU/US), brapi.dev (B3), Bundesbank SDMX (Basiszins) | ✓ Good |
| Insurance deferred to v2 | Data sourcing complexity, focus v1 on tax + investments | ✓ Good |
| Shared user profile | All agents read same `.finyx/profile.json` — integrated advice | ✓ Good |
| Hard cut rename (no coexistence) | Clean migration, simpler codebase | ✓ Good |
| Unconditional country doc loading | Minimal overhead, simplifies command gating logic | ✓ Good |
| VWCE as primary core ETF recommendation | Broadest diversification in single fund | ✓ Good |
| Net-after-mandatory income as benchmark denominator | Gross-based 50/30/20 is wrong for DE (~45% mandatory deductions) | ✓ Good |
| Traffic light + € gap display | Combines at-a-glance scan with actionable specifics | ✓ Good |
| Per-country scoring only (never combined) | Cross-jurisdiction combined scores are misleading | ✓ Good |
| Claude inference for cross-advisor links | Fits Markdown-prompt architecture, zero maintenance vs rule engine | ✓ Good |
| Profile-only data sourcing for insights | Agents read profile.json, never invoke other commands | ✓ Good |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd:transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
