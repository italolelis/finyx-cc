<objective>

Unified real estate investment skill covering the full workflow from location scouting through to advisor briefing generation. Routes to the correct workflow based on user intent.

**Workflows available:**
- **Scout** — Research a location: Erbpacht, transport, market conditions
- **Analyze** — Extract units from price lists, calculate yield, cashflow, tax benefits
- **Filter** — Apply investor criteria, create shortlist and exclusions file
- **Compare** — Side-by-side shortlist comparison with decision framework
- **Stress-test** — Run 4 risk scenarios (0% appreciation, rate hike, vacancy, combined worst-case)
- **Report** — Generate advisor briefing (Markdown, PDF, multi-language)
- **Rates** — Research current German mortgage rates and compare with developer rate

**Workflow sequence:**
Scout → Analyze → Filter → Compare → Stress-test → Report

Agents used:
- `finyx-location-scout` — spawned by Scout workflow
- `finyx-analyzer-agent` — spawned by Analyze workflow
- `finyx-reporter-agent` — spawned by Report workflow

All outputs are written to `.finyx/` in the user's project. All guidance appends the legal disclaimer from the loaded disclaimer.md reference.

# WORKFLOW 1: SCOUT

<scout_objective>

Research a location for real estate investment, gathering critical data:
- Development details (name, developer, size)
- Erbpacht status (CRITICAL - auto-exclude if undisclosed)
- Public transport quality
- Parking necessity assessment
- Market conditions

**Creates:** `.finyx/research/locations/[location].md`

**After this workflow:** Run analyze [location] to calculate metrics.

</scout_objective>

<scout_process>

## Phase 1: Validation

**Check profile exists:**
```bash
[ -f .finyx/profile.json ] || { echo "ERROR: No financial profile found. Run /finyx:profile first to set up your profile."; exit 1; }
```

**Parse location argument:**
Extract location name from user input (e.g., "kassel" from "scout kassel")

**Check location folder:**
```bash
[ -d "properties/$LOCATION" ] && echo "EXISTS" || echo "NOT_FOUND"
```

If NOT_FOUND, ask user:
- "Location folder 'properties/[location]' not found. Create it?"
- If yes: `mkdir -p "properties/$LOCATION"`

## Phase 2: Document Discovery

**Scan for existing documents:**
```bash
find "properties/$LOCATION" -type f \( -name "*.pdf" -o -name "*.xlsx" -o -name "*.xls" \) 2>/dev/null
```

Note what's available:
- Price lists (Kaufpreisliste, Preisliste)
- Exposés/brochures
- Calculation examples (Berechnung)
- Floor plans

## Phase 3: Development Research

**Search for development information:**

Web searches:
- "[location] Neubau [current year]"
- "[development name if found in docs] [location]"
- "[developer name if found] [location] project"

**Extract:**
- Development name
- Developer/builder name
- Project size (number of units)
- Address
- Expected completion date
- Project concept (car-free, sustainable, etc.)

## Phase 4: Erbpacht Detection (CRITICAL)

**This is the most important check. Erbpacht with undisclosed costs = EXCLUDE.**

### 4.1 Document Search

Search documents for Erbpacht indicators:
```bash
grep -ri "erbpacht\|erbbaurecht\|erbbauzins" "properties/$LOCATION/" 2>/dev/null
```

### 4.2 Price List Analysis

If Excel price list available, check:
- Grundstücksanteil (land share) percentage
- If land share < 15% → ERBPACHT SUSPECTED

### 4.3 Web Search

Search for Erbpacht mentions:
- "[development name] [location] Erbpacht"
- "[development name] Erbbaurecht"
- "[developer name] ground lease"

### 4.4 Determination

**ERBPACHT STATUS:**
- `✅ NO ERBPACHT DETECTED` - No evidence found, proceed
- `⚠️ ERBPACHT SUSPECTED` - Indicators found, needs verification
- `🚨 ERBPACHT CONFIRMED` - Confirmed, check if costs disclosed

**If CONFIRMED:**
- Search for Erbbauzins (annual ground rent) amount
- Check remaining lease term
- If costs NOT disclosed → **RECOMMEND EXCLUSION**

## Phase 5: Transport Research

**Research public transport quality:**

Web searches:
- "[location] public transport network"
- "[location] tram bus S-Bahn"
- "[development name] location transport"
- "[location] ÖPNV"

**Extract:**
- Nearest public transport stop and distance
- Available lines (tram, bus, S-Bahn)
- Time to city center
- Network quality assessment (EXCELLENT/GOOD/MODERATE/POOR)

## Phase 6: Parking Assessment

**Based on transport quality + development concept:**

**If EXCELLENT transport AND development mentions:**
- "autofrei" (car-free)
- "autoarm" (car-reduced)
- "reduced traffic"
- "walkable"
- Urban location

→ **Parking: VALUABLE BUT NOT ESSENTIAL**

**If MODERATE/POOR transport OR:**
- Suburban location
- Family-oriented development
- Limited public transport

→ **Parking: ESSENTIAL**

## Phase 7: Market Research

**Research local market conditions:**

Web searches:
- "[location] housing market [current year]"
- "[location] Wohnungsmarkt"
- "[location] rental demand"
- "[location] property prices development"

**Extract:**
- Housing deficit/surplus
- Price trend
- Rental demand level
- Major employers/universities nearby

## Phase 8: Write Research File

Create `.finyx/research/locations/[location].md`:

# WORKFLOW 2: ANALYZE

<analyze_objective>

Analyze all properties in a location folder:
1. Extract units from price lists (Excel/PDF)
2. Calculate metrics (yield, price/m², cashflow)
3. Apply investor's tax rate for after-tax projections
4. Rank by real metrics (not brochure IRR)

**Creates:**
- `.finyx/analysis/[location]/UNITS.md` — All extracted units
- `.finyx/analysis/[location]/RANKED.md` — Sorted by metrics

**After this workflow:** Run filter [location] to apply criteria and create shortlist.

</analyze_objective>

<analyze_process>

## Phase 1: Validation

**Check profile and location:**
```bash
[ -f .finyx/profile.json ] || { echo "ERROR: No financial profile found. Run /finyx:profile first to set up your profile."; exit 1; }
[ -d "properties/$LOCATION" ] || echo "NO_LOCATION"
```

**Load investor profile:**
Read `.finyx/profile.json` to get:
- `investor.marginalRate` — For tax benefit calculations
- `investor.country` — For country-specific rules
- `criteria.*` — For later filtering
- `assumptions.*` — For projections

## Phase 2: Find Price Lists

**Search for price list files:**
```bash
find "properties/$LOCATION" -type f \( -name "*[Pp]reis*" -o -name "*[Kk]aufpreis*" -o -name "*[Pp]rice*" \) \( -name "*.xlsx" -o -name "*.xls" -o -name "*.pdf" \)
```

**If Excel file found:** Extract data programmatically
**If PDF only:** May need manual extraction or OCR

## Phase 3: Extract Units

### From Excel Price List

For each row in the price list, extract:

| Field | Source Column (typical) |
|-------|------------------------|
| Unit ID | WE, Einheit, Unit |
| Floor | Etage, OG, Floor |
| Size (m²) | Wohnfläche, m², Size |
| Rooms | Zimmer, Rooms |
| Price | Kaufpreis, Price |
| Parking | Stellplatz, TG, Parking |
| Rent | Kaltmiete, Miete, Rent |
| Kitchen included | EBK, Küche |

**Calculate derived fields:**

```
Price per m² = Total Price ÷ Size
Gross Yield = (Monthly Rent × 12) ÷ Total Price × 100
```

### Handle Missing Rent Data

If rent not in price list, estimate:
- Check if developer calculation docs have rent estimates
- Use local market rate (€/m²) from research
- Flag as ESTIMATED

## Phase 4: Calculate Metrics Per Unit

**For each unit, calculate:**

### 4.1 Basic Metrics

```
Total Price = Unit Price + Kitchen (if not included) + Parking (if separate)
Price per m² = Total Price ÷ Size
Monthly Rent = Given or Estimated
Annual Rent = Monthly Rent × 12
Gross Yield = Annual Rent ÷ Total Price × 100
```

### 4.2 Upfront Cash (Kaufnebenkosten)

```
Nebenkosten = Total Price × NK_RATE (from config, typically 8%)
Construction Interest = Total Price × 50% × Interest Rate × (Construction Months ÷ 12)
Total Upfront = Nebenkosten + Construction Interest
```

### 4.3 Monthly Cashflow (Before Tax)

```
INCOME:
+ Monthly Rent

EXPENSES:
- Mortgage Payment = Total Price × (Interest Rate + Tilgung Rate) ÷ 12
- Verwaltung = Size × €1.00
- Rücklage = Size × €0.60

Real Deficit = Rent - Mortgage - Verwaltung - Rücklage
```

### 4.4 Tax Benefit Calculation

**Years 1-4 (with Sonder-AfA):**
```
Building Portion = Total Price × 92%
Annual Deductions:
  + Interest = Total Price × Interest Rate
  + Verwaltung = Size × €1.00 × 12
  + Sonder-AfA = Building Portion × 5%
  + Regular AfA = Building Portion × 2%

Tax Loss = Annual Rent - Annual Deductions
Tax Benefit Y1-4 = |Tax Loss| × Marginal Rate
Monthly Benefit Y1-4 = Tax Benefit Y1-4 ÷ 12
```

**Years 5-10 (Regular AfA only):**
```
Annual Deductions:
  + Interest (declining, estimate 85% of Y1)
  + Verwaltung
  + Regular AfA = Building Portion × 2%

Tax Loss = Annual Rent - Annual Deductions
Tax Benefit Y5-10 = |Tax Loss| × Marginal Rate
Monthly Benefit Y5-10 = Tax Benefit Y5-10 ÷ 12
```

### 4.5 After-Tax Cashflow

```
Cashflow Y1-4 = Real Deficit + Monthly Benefit Y1-4
Cashflow Y5-10 = Real Deficit + Monthly Benefit Y5-10
```

### 4.6 Exit Projection (Year 10)

```
Exit Value = Total Price × (1 + Appreciation Rate)^10
Sale Costs = Exit Value × 7%
Remaining Loan = Total Price × (1 - 10 years of Tilgung)
Net at Sale = Exit Value - Sale Costs - Remaining Loan

Total Cash Invested = Upfront + (Negative Cashflow over 10 years)
Profit = Net at Sale - Total Cash Invested
ROE = Profit ÷ Total Cash Invested × 100
```

## Excel Extraction Tips

When reading Excel price lists:
- Headers are often in row 1 or 2
- Look for merged cells in headers
- Unit IDs may have prefixes (WE, Whg, etc.)
- Prices may be formatted with currency symbols
- Some cells may have formulas

## Handling Edge Cases

- **No rent data:** Use market rate estimate, flag as estimated
- **Multiple buildings:** Analyze as separate locations or combine
- **Missing parking info:** Assume no parking unless stated
- **Kitchen unclear:** Check exposé or assume not included

</analyze_notes>

# WORKFLOW 3: FILTER

<filter_objective>

Apply investor's criteria to analyzed units and create a filtered shortlist:
1. Load criteria from config
2. Apply filters (yield, price, size, parking, floor)
3. Document exclusions with reasons
4. Create shortlist of qualifying units

**Creates:**
- `.finyx/analysis/[location]/SHORTLIST.md` — Qualifying units
- `.finyx/analysis/[location]/EXCLUSIONS.md` — Excluded units with reasons

**After this workflow:** Run compare to compare across locations.

</filter_objective>

<filter_process>

## Phase 1: Load Data

**Check profile exists:**
```bash
[ -f .finyx/profile.json ] || { echo "ERROR: No financial profile found. Run /finyx:profile first to set up your profile."; exit 1; }
```

**Load profile:**
Read `.finyx/profile.json` for criteria:
- `criteria.minYield`
- `criteria.maxPrice`
- `criteria.minSize` / `criteria.maxSize`
- `criteria.bedrooms`
- `criteria.parkingRequired`
- `criteria.excludeGroundFloor`
- `criteria.excludeErbpacht`

**Load analyzed units:**
Read `.finyx/analysis/[location]/UNITS.md`

## Phase 2: Apply Filters

**For each unit, check against criteria:**

```
PASS/FAIL Criteria:
─────────────────────────────────────────
□ Yield ≥ [minYield]%
□ Price ≤ €[maxPrice]
□ Size between [minSize] - [maxSize] m²
□ Bedrooms in [bedrooms] list
□ If parkingRequired: has parking
□ If excludeGroundFloor: not ground floor
□ If excludeErbpacht: no Erbpacht detected
```

**Track exclusion reasons:**
- "Yield below minimum (X% < Y%)"
- "Price exceeds maximum (€X > €Y)"
- "Size outside range (Xm²)"
- "Wrong bedroom count"
- "No parking (required)"
- "Ground floor (excluded)"

## Phase 3: Rank Qualifying Units

# WORKFLOW 4: COMPARE

<compare_objective>

Create comprehensive side-by-side comparison of all shortlisted properties:
- Gather shortlists from all analyzed locations
- Present unified comparison table
- Provide decision framework for each option
- Highlight trade-offs

**Output:** Display comparison and update `.finyx/STATE.md` with comparison status.

**After this workflow:** Run stress-test for scenarios, or report to generate advisor briefing.

</compare_objective>

<compare_process>

## Phase 1: Gather Shortlists

**Check profile exists:**
```bash
[ -f .finyx/profile.json ] || { echo "ERROR: No financial profile found. Run /finyx:profile first to set up your profile."; exit 1; }
```

**Find all shortlist files:**
```bash
find .finyx/analysis -name "SHORTLIST.md" 2>/dev/null
```

**For each shortlist, extract:**
- Location name
- Shortlisted units with all metrics

**If no shortlists found:**
"No shortlists created yet. Run filter [location] first."

## Phase 2: Load Investor Profile

Read `.finyx/profile.json` for:
- Liquid assets (for buffer calculation)
- Criteria (for highlighting matches)
- Preferences (parking, floor, etc.)

## Phase 3: Build Comparison Table

# WORKFLOW 5: STRESS-TEST

<stress_objective>

Run stress test scenarios on shortlisted properties:
1. Zero appreciation scenario (0% growth over 10 years)
2. Interest rate hike scenario (rates increase at refinancing)
3. Vacancy scenario (extended periods without rent)
4. Combined worst-case scenario

**Creates:** `.finyx/analysis/STRESS-TEST.md`

**After this workflow:** Run report to include stress test results in advisor briefing.

</stress_objective>

<stress_process>

## Phase 1: Load Data

**Check profile exists:**
```bash
[ -f .finyx/profile.json ] || { echo "ERROR: No financial profile found. Run /finyx:profile first to set up your profile."; exit 1; }
```

**Load profile:**
Read `.finyx/profile.json` for:
- Investor profile
- Current assumptions (interest rate, appreciation)

**Load shortlists:**
Read all `.finyx/analysis/*/SHORTLIST.md`

**Extract baseline projections for each shortlisted unit:**
- Total price
- Upfront costs
- Monthly cashflow Y1-4
- Monthly cashflow Y5-10
- Exit value (baseline)
- Profit (baseline)

## Phase 2: Scenario 1 - Zero Appreciation

**For each shortlisted unit, recalculate with 0% appreciation:**

```
Exit Value (0%) = Total Price (no growth)
Sale Costs = Exit Value × 7%
Remaining Loan = [same as baseline]
Net at Sale = Exit Value - Sale Costs - Remaining Loan

Total Cash Invested = [same as baseline]
Profit (0%) = Net at Sale - Total Cash Invested
ROE (0%) = Profit ÷ Total Cash Invested × 100
```

**Output table:**

| Unit | Baseline Profit | 0% Profit | Difference | Still Profitable? |
|------|-----------------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| [UNIT] | €[BASE] | €[ZERO] | -€[DIFF] | YES/NO |

## Phase 3: Scenario 2 - Interest Rate Hike

**Assumptions:**
- Current rate: X.XX% (from config)
- Hike scenario: +2% at year 10 refinancing
- Calculate new monthly payment after refinancing

**For each unit:**

```
Current Monthly Payment = Total Price × (Interest + Tilgung) ÷ 12
Remaining Loan at Y10 = Total Price × (1 - 10 years Tilgung)

New Rate = Current Rate + 2%
New Monthly Payment = Remaining Loan × (New Rate + Tilgung) ÷ 12
Payment Increase = New Payment - Current Payment

New Monthly Cashflow = Current Rent - New Payment - Expenses
```

**Output table:**

| Unit | Current Payment | +2% Payment | Increase | New Cashflow |
|------|-----------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| [UNIT] | €[CURRENT] | €[NEW] | +€[DIFF] | €[CASHFLOW] |

## Phase 4: Scenario 3 - Extended Vacancy

**Assumptions:**
- Scenario: 3 months vacancy every 2 years
- Impact: Loss of 12.5% of annual rent

**For each unit:**

```
Annual Rent Loss = Monthly Rent × 1.5 (avg per year)
Impact on Y1-4 Cashflow = Rent Loss - (Rent Loss × Tax Rate)
Impact on Y5-10 Cashflow = Rent Loss - (Rent Loss × Tax Rate)

10-Year Vacancy Cost = Annual Rent Loss × 10
```

**Output table:**

| Unit | Monthly Rent | Annual Loss | 10-Year Cost | Adjusted Profit |
|------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| [UNIT] | €[RENT] | €[LOSS] | €[TOTAL] | €[PROFIT] |

## Phase 5: Scenario 4 - Combined Worst Case

**Combine all stress factors:**
- 0% appreciation
- +2% interest rate hike at refinancing
- Vacancy losses

**For each unit:**

```
Exit Value = Purchase Price (no appreciation)
Vacancy Cost = 10-Year Vacancy Loss
Higher Payments Y10+ = Payment Increase × remaining months

Worst Case Profit = 0% Profit - Vacancy Cost
```

**Output table:**

| Unit | Baseline | 0% Apprec | + Vacancy | Worst Case | Status |
|------|----------|-----------|-----------|------------|--------|
| [UNIT] | €[BASE] | €[ZERO] | €[VAC] | €[WORST] | [STATUS] |

**Status indicators:**
- PROFITABLE: Still makes money
- BREAK-EVEN: Within ±€2,000
- LOSS: Loses money but <€10,000
- SIGNIFICANT LOSS: Loses >€10,000

## Phase 6: Risk Assessment

**Generate risk summary for each unit:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 RISK ASSESSMENT: [UNIT]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Baseline Profit:    €[PROFIT]
Worst Case:         €[WORST]
Risk Buffer:        €[BUFFER]

Key Vulnerabilities:
• [Appreciation sensitivity: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
• [Interest rate sensitivity: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
• [Vacancy sensitivity: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

Resilience Score: [1-10]

Assessment: [DESCRIPTION]
```

**Resilience scoring:**
- 10: Profitable in worst case
- 7-9: Break-even or small loss in worst case
- 4-6: Moderate loss in worst case
- 1-3: Significant loss in worst case

## Phase 8: PDF Generation (if --pdf specified)

**If `--pdf` flag is present:**

### Step 1: Check for PDF converter

Try converters in order of preference:

```bash
# Check for pandoc (best quality)
command -v pandoc >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "PANDOC"

# Check for mdpdf
command -v mdpdf >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "MDPDF"

# Check for md-to-pdf via npx
npx --yes md-to-pdf --version >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "MD_TO_PDF"
```

### Step 2: Convert to PDF

**Using pandoc (preferred):**
```bash
pandoc "[MARKDOWN_FILE]" \
  -o "[PDF_FILE]" \
  --pdf-engine=xelatex \
  -V geometry:margin=2.5cm \
  -V fontsize=11pt \
  -V colorlinks=true \
  -V linkcolor=blue \
  --toc \
  --toc-depth=2
```

**If xelatex not available, try with default engine:**
```bash
pandoc "[MARKDOWN_FILE]" \
  -o "[PDF_FILE]" \
  -V geometry:margin=2.5cm \
  -V fontsize=11pt
```

**Using md-to-pdf (fallback):**
```bash
npx --yes md-to-pdf "[MARKDOWN_FILE]"
```

**Using mdpdf (alternative):**
```bash
mdpdf "[MARKDOWN_FILE]" "[PDF_FILE]"
```

### Step 3: Verify PDF created

```bash
[ -f "[PDF_FILE]" ] && echo "PDF created successfully"
```

### PDF Filenames

- Full report: `.finyx/output/BRIEFING-[DATE].pdf`
- Short report: `.finyx/output/SUMMARY-[DATE].pdf`

### If no converter available

Display:
```
⚠️ PDF generation requires a converter. Install one of:

Option 1 - Pandoc (recommended):
  brew install pandoc          # macOS
  apt install pandoc           # Ubuntu/Debian

  For best results, also install LaTeX:
  brew install --cask mactex   # macOS
  apt install texlive-xetex    # Ubuntu/Debian

Option 2 - md-to-pdf (Node.js):
  npm install -g md-to-pdf

Option 3 - mdpdf (Node.js):
  npm install -g mdpdf

Markdown report saved: [MARKDOWN_FILE]
Convert manually or install a converter and run again.

```

## Phase 4: Calculate Savings

**For each shortlisted unit, calculate:**

```
Loan amount: €[PRICE]
10-year difference at 0.15% lower rate:

Monthly interest savings: Loan × 0.15% ÷ 12
Annual savings: Monthly × 12
10-year savings: Annual × 10 (simplified)
```

**No profile found:**
```
ERROR: No financial profile found.
Run /finyx:profile first to complete your financial profile.
```

**No location folder:**
```

```

**No shortlists for compare/stress-test/report:**
```
ERROR: No shortlists found.
Run filter [location] first to create shortlists.

## Workflow Sequence

The recommended sequence is:
1. scout [location] — research viability
2. analyze [location] — extract and calculate
3. filter [location] — apply criteria
4. compare — side-by-side
5. stress-test — risk scenarios
6. report — advisor briefing

Steps 4-6 are optional. You can generate a report after filtering without comparing or stress-testing.

## Multiple Locations

- Scout and analyze each location independently
- filter each location
- compare consolidates ALL shortlists from all locations
- report covers all analyzed locations

## Agents

This skill uses three specialist agents via the Task tool:
- `finyx-location-scout` — Web research for scout workflow
- `finyx-analyzer-agent` — Price list extraction and metric calculation
- `finyx-reporter-agent` — Report generation and formatting
