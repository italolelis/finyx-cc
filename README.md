## What it does

Finyx is a collection of Claude Code slash-commands and specialist AI agents that give integrated financial advice. Unlike siloed tools that only know one domain, Finyx knows your full financial picture — tax situation, investments, pensions, and real estate — and gives cross-domain recommendations.

**Key capabilities:**

- **Tax advisor** — German (Abgeltungssteuer, Sparerpauschbetrag, Vorabpauschale, Teilfreistellung) and Brazilian (IR, DARF, come-cotas, FII exemptions) investment tax guidance
- **Investment advisor** — Portfolio analysis, risk profiling, ETF recommendations, rebalancing suggestions with live market data (Finnhub, brapi.dev)
- **Broker comparison** — DE + BR brokers with fee comparison and tax-reporting quality
- **Pension planning** — Riester/Rürup/bAV (Germany), PGBL/VGBL/INSS (Brazil), cross-country projection
- **Financial insights** — Unified health report with income allocation analysis, tax efficiency scoring, net worth snapshot, goal pace tracking, and ranked recommendations
- **Real estate analysis** — Location research, property analysis, comparison, stress testing, and advisor-ready reports
- **Cross-border support** — Built for expats with obligations in multiple jurisdictions (Germany + Brazil)

## How it works

Finyx is not an application — it's a set of Markdown prompt files that Claude Code interprets as slash commands. All "business logic" is encoded in structured prompts, not executable code.

```
finyx-cc/
├── bin/install.js              # CLI installer (the only JS file)
├── commands/finyx/             # Slash-command prompt files
│   ├── profile.md              # /finyx:profile
│   ├── tax.md                  # /finyx:tax
│   ├── invest.md               # /finyx:invest
│   ├── insights.md             # /finyx:insights
│   └── ...
├── agents/                     # Specialist AI sub-agents

└── finyx/

    │   ├── germany/
    │   ├── brazil/
    │   ├── insights/
    │   └── disclaimer.md
    └── templates/              # Config and output templates
```

**Zero runtime dependencies.** The only code is the installer. Everything else is Markdown consumed by Claude Code.

## Country support

| Country | Tax | Investment | Pension | Real Estate | Broker |
|---------|-----|-----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| Germany | Abgeltungssteuer, Sparerpauschbetrag, Vorabpauschale, Teilfreistellung | ETF/stock analysis, live Finnhub data | Riester, Rürup, bAV | Full pipeline | Interactive Brokers, Trade Republic, Scalable, etc. |

Cross-border users get integrated advice across both jurisdictions with DBA residency tiebreaker and withholding credit mechanics.

## Financial insights dashboard

The `/finyx:insights` command synthesizes all your financial data into a single report:

- **Income allocation** — Needs/wants/savings/investments/debt breakdown vs country-adjusted benchmarks (net-after-mandatory income, not gross)
- **Tax efficiency** — Per-country traffic-light scoring with € gap amounts (Sparerpauschbetrag usage, Vorabpauschale readiness, PGBL optimization)
- **Net worth snapshot** — Assets vs liabilities from your profile
- **Goal tracking** — "At current rate, target X reached in Y months"
- **Top-5 recommendations** — Ranked by estimated € annual impact
- **Cross-advisor intelligence** — Detects links across domains (unused tax allowance + low investment = double gap)
